      "My own identity. A triangular monogram built from the initials, anchored " +
      "by a deep-maroon, black and white palette. The mark scales from a favicon " +
      "to a building sign — carried across a full stationery and merch system.",
    story: [
      "N9 is a self-portrait drawn in geometry. The N is taken from my own name; the 9 is my number — the figure I've always been drawn to — so the monogram sits somewhere between a signature and a personal talisman. It isn't a logo I designed for a brief. It's the mark I'd want to sign everything with.",
      "I locked both characters inside a triangle on purpose. The triangle is the form I keep returning to — the most stable structure there is, three points holding tension in perfect balance. It reads at once as a peak to climb and a foundation that won't move, and that duality is exactly how I see the work I do.",
      "The palette is anything but decorative. To me, deep red and black aren't colours — they're a feeling: power, weight, presence. Black sets the authority; the red cuts through it with intent. Together they give the mark gravity before a single word is read.",
      "From a single idea it becomes a complete system. The mark is engineered to hold up at any scale — embroidered on a chest, embossed on a card, or lit three metres tall above a door — with the same logic of contrast, spacing and proportion carried across stationery, merchandise and signage. One identity, fully resolved, ready to live anywhere it needs to.",

    story: [
      "A'soud Academy is the multi-sport academy of A'soud Global School — a premium British international school in Muscat, Oman. The brief was clear: train and develop young athletes aged 6 to 18 to the same standard the school holds in the classroom, and give that ambition an identity worthy of a high-level institution. The guiding line: “developing future champions through excellence in sport and education.”",
      "The mark answers that with a crest. The shield speaks to academy, protection and prestige; inside it, a stylised “A” is drawn from dynamic, sweeping lines that read as movement, progression and an athlete in motion. Crowning the shield, a single star stands for excellence, ambition and the champion's mindset the academy sets out to build.",
      "The palette is deliberately premium and institutional. Navy carries trust, education and reliability; gold signals excellence and prestige; white keeps it clean and clear; and a red star adds focus and drive. Together they place the academy firmly between serious education and high-level sport.",
      "From there it becomes a working system. The crest is engineered to hold up in monochrome, at small sizes, and embroidered onto sportswear — readable on both light and dark backgrounds — and it carries cleanly across business cards, letterhead, signage, apparel, bags and merchandise. One identity, structured and inspiring, ready for everything an academy needs.",

The Persian letters of the word مثلث are reshaped and locked together to form the very thing they name — a triangle — and that monogram is then framed inside a clean triangular mark. You read the word and see the shape in the same glance; the meaning is the design.",
      "The execution is kept deliberately modern and minimal. A confident red-black-and-white palette and tight geometry give the mark presence, while staying simple enough to read perfectly as a small Instagram avatar and stay crisp across posts, stories and packaging.",
